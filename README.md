# HelloWorld

## Overview

This is a slightly more complex version of the "Hello World" used in classrooms everywhere to help new developers get a feel for the language they are learning. In this version the user is asked for their name and then greeted with it. The system also displays the current date and time to the user.

The point of this program was to show a variation of the traditional introductory program we all know that adds a few more elements of complexity while still being relatively simple.

Here is a brief video going over the code and a demonstration of its function. https://youtu.be/yGK30zTJCIE
